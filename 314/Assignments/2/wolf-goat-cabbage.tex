\section{The Wolf-Goat-Cabbage Problem}

  \subsection{Question 1}

    Below is a graph representing the relationships between all possible states
    in the Wolf-Goat-Cabbage Problem. In one depiction, error states and transitions are
    included. This means that while traversing these is possible with the type of actions
    available, it is ``incorrect'' in the context of the problem at hand. Therefore a second
    graphic is provided, which eliminates states and transitions that are forbidden.

  \subsection{Question 2}

  Below is a tree representation of actions that may be taken to convert all
  actors being on one bank to another. Further, the error states (ie. all leaves that
  are not the goal state), are written $A \rightarrow B$, which reads as ``A
  consumes B''. States are ordered in ``BWGC'', such that a movement involving
  only the boat will always appear as the far left child, if one exists.

    $$1111 \rightarrow 0101 \rightarrow 1101 \rightarrow 0001 \rightarrow 1011
    \rightarrow 0010 \rightarrow 1010 \rightarrow 0000$$
