\section{The Wolf-Goat-Cabbage Problem}

  \subsection{Question 1}

    Below is a graph representing the relationships between all possible states
    in the Wolf-Goat-Cabbage Problem. In this graphic:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textcolor{gray}{\textbf{Grey}} edges represent a movement of the
      boat with no animals.
      \item \textcolor{green}{\textbf{Green}} edges represent a movement with
      the cabbage on the boat.
      \item \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{Blue}} edges represent a movement with the
      goat on the boat.
      \item \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Red}} edges represent a movement with the
      wolf on the boat.
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip
    All edges are considered bidirectional (since the activities can be done in
    reverse).

  \subsection{Question 2}

  Below is a tree representation of actions that may be taken to convert all
actors being on one bank to another. The children are ordered left-to-right
\textbf{B}(oat), \textbf{W}(olf), \textbf{G}(oat), \textbf{C}(abbage), meaning
that a movement of the boat with no animals will always appear as the most left
child (if such a move is possible).
\\\\
Further, the error states (ie. all leaves that
are not the goal state), are written $A \rightarrow B$, which reads as ``A
consumes B''.

    \rightarrow 0010 \rightarrow 1010 \rightarrow 0000$$
